If documents are recrawled, the chunks get overwritten, and client finds this not a scalable approach, as there will be a lot of manual work every time they want to recrawl.\n\n2) Is there a way to control chunking behavior in general, maybe part of the indexing pipeline?\n\n3) How do we handle language detection? Client has data crawled in english, but wants to allow someone, let say, in german to ask a question and get a response in german. Maybe approach is german input --> detection and translation into english --> english query submitted to SA --> english chunks and detected language sent to LLM --> LLM paraphrases and translates into originating language (german) to be sent back to user.\n\n4) Is there a way to do pre and post processing before sending to LLM's. Sometimes chunks are cut off in the middle of crucial data, and includes data (like lookup data) that might be best served processed on the platform, not the LLM. For example, client asks about a cost of making a phone call from Germany to Syria. The info about country costs are similar across groups of countries. Instead of sending all the groups of countries to the LLM (which takes up a lot of chunk space), let a lookup to the country group happen in preprocessing, let LLM figure out the cost between country groups, and post processing can revert back to the originating countries.\n\n5) Is there a way to batch test many queries against the search engine. Sometimes doing 1 at a time takes too long.\n\n6) Is there an issue with the SA GUI returning responses to the user when testing? Client found that response times from the engine and LLM are fast but response is not returned quickly.\n\n7) Do we support crawling of tables from html files? How well does this work?",

        "For PDFs, each page of the pdf will be treated as a document. This document count is used as a threshold on the total indexed content.\n\nFor answering, the content from these pages is further broken down into smaller chunks. Chunk size can be configured. We create vector representation of each of these chunks so that we can retrieve them based on semantic similarity. For vectorizing, we use open source LLM embeddings. There is no cost involved here. \n\nFor a given user input, we retrieve the relevant chunks based on vector/semantic similarity. The qualified chunks along with the user input are sent to LLMs for answer generation. LLMs calculate the cost based on size of the prompt in terms of tokens used in request and response. So, for every call we make, LLM will calculates the cost based on the prompt (includes instructions, chunks, user input) and response (answer). \n\nDetermining the right chunk size is an important aspect. Larger chunks usually result in better coverage of the answer. However, larger chunks will result in higher cost and in some cases, the models may not be fully grounded  with larger context sizes. \n\nSmaller chunks may not provide better answer coverage. They will result in lower cost and more grounded. But the answer quality may not be satisfactory. \n\nSo, enterprises will need to experiment for the optimal chunk size based on use case."

We change the embeddings to LaBSE and index the documents. Now at runtime when the user is asking a question (in any language) we convert it to a vector and perform a vector match. We then pass the qualified chunks along with the query to the LLM. So depending on the LLM you are using and the no of languages it can handle we can achieve what you have mentioned.

So it's not an issue of SearchAssist giving the wrong answer, as it is a well-known fact that LLM's have issues with consistency and hallucination. \n\nIf the problem is that SearchAssist is qualifying different chunks every time for the same query, you can send us the query along with the debug payload, and we will look into what's wrong with chunk qualification. \n\nThe only thing we can do for the consistency issue as of now is to edit the prompt according to the use case. Which is why we have given the user complete control over the prompt, with the option to switch between different prompt versions. \nFor example, you can add more relevant few-shot examples to the prompt(more examples like the one you have provided before). You can also add instructions to the prompt to mention the reasoning with facts and then mention the answer (Also known as chain of thought prompting) \nThere are several different methods of prompting (COT, TOT,COK, etc) that can be employed to improve the LLM’s performance which one to use will depend on the use case. \n\nSome other solutions we are actively exploring for this issue are: \n1. Guardrails- To not show answers to the users that contain false information \n2. Caching- Caching LLM responses based on certain parameters and showing them to the user instead of making a new LLM call for each query. This will also have cost benefits. \n\nI’ll let you know when these features are available."

        "Hi Team, we have a few RFI questions on access control/role management. Please see below\n\n1) The system should fully respect access controls in the respective repositories, and security trim to only present results from content to which the users have permission to access. (both EX and CX use cases)\n\n2) Describe how “real-time” your security trimming is. For example, if the access controls on a piece of content changes, how quickly will that change be reflected in response the bot presents.\n\nCan this be configured on SearchAssist, or is this dependent on XO-P, where the VA is built? I couldn't find information on the SearchAssist documentation. Please advise. Thank you. (cc:  @Tim Burke)",
        "Hi Mohan \n\nWe currently don't have RACL for SearchAssist. It's in the roadmap. \n\nI can't comment on the XO bot part, but if you were using the Advanced Search API, you could define the rules as metafilters, and SearchAssist will honor them. But this requires that the information is also a part of the chunk metadata at the time of ingestion (Might have an impact on the method of ingestion). Additionally, we would have to capture this information at run time, so we also need to understand how that information can be sent and converted to appropriate metafilters. To sum it up, while it could be achieved, there will be custom implementation involved with several dependencies.",

We will have representation from product, engineering, and documentation in these calls. Everyone is free to join and raise any questions or difficulties they want our help with.\n\nOur goal would be to make additions to the product based on your feedback and also document the questions so that it is easily available for anyone who might need assistance with using SearchAssist.\n\nThis is an effort from our side to enable the SE and sales team so that we can make SearchAssist a successful product.\n\nWe request you to make full use of these sessions to discuss any questions you may have about the SearchAssist/Answers functionality for RFPs, demos, PoCs, and general queries from prospects. As this is a recurring session, we request you to join based on your needs.\n\nWe request you to not set up specific calls for individual customer/prospect-specific clarifications.

For scoring, we are using a custom algorithm which is a combination of the weighted sum of text scoring (bm25 variation), vector similarity, field-specific language analyzers, etc\n\n2. scores are not bounded because they are calculated relative to other documents in the index, based on factors like term frequency and inverse document frequency. This allows for more accurate ranking and relevancy of search results.",

Using this, enterprises can pre-process every document and choose to exclude it from ingesting, modify certain parts or part, enrich with additional context et.c\n\n#2 - SearchAssist stores complete information on how LLMs are used for answering.

Can anyone shed some light on this for me?  \nMy prospect asks: Can the dataset be categorized according to distinct contexts?\nAre there access control measures available for categorizing confidential or restricted information, meaning not every user can access all contexts—for example, limiting certain information only to authorized or designated users?",

        "Answer from @Aditi Bhadouria  stated: \nRACL is a feature we are currently developing. But it has a lot of nuances and will be rolled out in phases. I think it's important to highlight the details of each phase to you, and probably good to tell the customer as well. I'll let you take the call there. \n\nPhase 1: RACL support with implementation work required. \nThis is already available and can be achieved via Business Rules and Metadata. At design time, we will ingest the list of user identities that have access to a document along with the document as metadata. At run time, the client will be responsible for passing the correct identity and identity groups for a user as metafilter, based on which SearchAssist will filter the documents and return the answer. \n\nPhase 2: RACL support directly integrated with connectors (Tentative ETA July; we will try to deliver it sooner if feasible)\nAs part of phase 2, we will pull in the associated permissions of a document directly from the connector along with each document. Additionally, we will also pull in all the information related to various user identities, groups, etc, and maintain it within SearchAssist. We will have a configuration where the client can select how often they want to sync this list. So, at runtime, we would just need the user identity, and SearchAssist will be able to filter the content and provide the answer. This could be passed as user context and doesn't need metafilters to be configured. \n\nPhase 3: RACL support with a mapping between unique user identities\nThis is not fully thought out yet, and we don't have any solid timelines around it. But here, we want to allow the clients to configure a mapping between user identities. For example, abc@gmail.com in Google Drive, and abc@123 in Confluence. The actual user identity shared as part of the search call abc@outlook.com. Additionally, we also want to allow clients to manually create the identities and map it to documents. Again to clarify we can not commit anything for Phase 3 or when it will be available, this is just a high-level overview. \n\nI hope that is helpful. Let me know if you have any more questions."

For a students an answer from link https://mhe.my.site.com/macmillanlearning/s/article/LMS-integration-troubleshooting-for-students should be displayed and for an Instructor an answer from link https://mhe.my.site.com/macmillanlearning/s/article/Instructors-Troubleshoot-deep-integration-with-Canvas should be displayed\n\nThey don't want to ask the user upfront whether they are a student or instructor, they want it to happen \"naturally\" in the flow of the conversation. \nExample \n(User): \"My grades are missing from Canvas?\" \n(VA): Are you a student or instructor?\n(User): I am an instuctor\n(VA): GenAI provides an answer in XO referencing this location https://mhe.my.site.com/macmillanlearning/s/article/Instructors-Troubleshoot-deep-integration-with-Canvas out of the two above links.\n\nSo there are really 3 paths\nAsk question and answer is displayed\nSame question is asked with two possible different answers for each persona\nProvide only the Instructors answer if the requester is an instructor asking \nProvide only the Students answer if the requester is an Student asking \n\nAny thoughts on how to accomplish this?

        "@David Taglieri you can either make the bot ask if the user is a student or instructor and pass that as a metafilter to SearchAssist while making the search call. \n\nOr a better user experience could be if you could capture the user identity through the login/browser etc and pass it as user context while making the search call. Then you would have to set up business rules to define which identity should get answers from which documents. For this you would also need some metadata as part of the ingested content. \n\nExample: \n{usercontext: student}\nBusiness rule: If usercontext=student then filter documents where  \"access=student\"\n\nThis would work given that you have the appropriate field in each document to identify which document has access for which users",

Bot developers can't invite other users, so to save (overnight) time, we resort to using Mailinator accounts and share the passwords. Furthermore, having the ability to add credits would be beneficial during enterprise customer PoCs, most of the time, the customer runs out of money during the POC stage only (before the contract) and yes we can argue that they can put their credit card and continue using it, it reflects poorly on us.

        "I need answers to these questions. Can someone please help? \n @Girish Ahankari  @Surendra Subhash Salke  @Rohit Tambe \n(Customer) Questions/Pressing Issues:\nHas KoreAI inbuilt any caching mechanism to keep predefined answers in it to get faster response (for selective search queries/ questions) rather than getting it from LLM? Though we see one option is, keeping the question and answer pair in datatable of bot Builder and fetch\nFacing latency (20 sec delay) while fetching Azure Open AI (GPT4 – hosted in CanadaWest) from Kore AI. Is it because Kore sits in US (region) AWS and trying to connect to Azure Open AI (GPT4 – hosted in CanadaWest)?\nUsing Kore AI connector (custom) for GCP connectivity – ticket raised with Kore for Auth Issue :  https://support.kore.ai/hc/en-us/requests/40849 . No response yet - Ticket #40849\nWhat we can do with custom configurations in SearchAssist as mentioned below.  What is the purpose of this configuration? What key value pair can be used to customize the search ?",
        "Cache: The generative AI caching feature is in the near roadmap. However, caching can be implemented as a custom solution with another searchassist application to keep the cached content and manage the cache coherence with the insert and delete content API. \n\nLatency: the delay in the generative AI solutions is mostly attributed to the generative AI response latency. Response time can be tracked using \"answers snippets -> simulation.\"\n\nSupport request: please allow me a day to come back on this.\n\nCustom configuration documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqSH_g0GZ8A6LvLZyCr2EB4Y7FlAj5Rdxo4TekQVunM/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXVmBbPJPZxDedtsStFjnXVQtmK2gsiO6Y4naHWp4po/edit?usp=drivesdk",

As part of this release, we upgraded the Node and Angular versions to address security vulnerabilities, which has unfortunately led to a few issues for new applications. However, existing applications appear to be unaffected.\n\nOur team is actively working to resolve these issues, and we expect to have them resolved before the start of the US morning hours. In the meantime, we kindly request that you use the PROD environment for any new application demos.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or require assistance with demos during this period, please let us know, and we'll be happy to provide support.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the disruption and appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to resolve these temporary issues promptly."

I know that I'm going to be asked the question, \"Can you crawl our past issues (tickets) in Jira?\" The documentation for our Confluence connector specifically states that it only crawls \"manually created Knowledge articles in Confluence\" (https://docs.kore.ai/searchassist/manage-content-sources/connectors/confluence-connector/).\n\nHow can we add support for crawling issues to our connector for Confluence?\n\nOr perhaps more specifically, can we add a connector to crawl Jira?",
        "Good use case👍",
        "I am aware that crawling issues in Jira will require me to either create a new OAuth credential with Jira-specific scopes, or add those scopes to an existing credential being used by SearchAssist (which is what I did here). My hope is that the data mapping of the various elements within an issue isn't too difficult.",
        "We will be presenting this demo to Capital One tomorrow, 03 MAY at 13:00 EDT.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your thoughts about crawling Jira well before then!",
        "@Todd Lewis Jira connector is in our immediate roadmap. We will be adding it as a new integration, and yes that would require you to get JIRA specific credentials and configure a new connector apart from Confluence.",
        "If you have any inputs from the client on how to use that connector and perform the data mapping, I'd be happy to take that input and use it in the development of the feature.",
        "That's great! There isn't a way to create a page in Confluence that takes all of its information from a Jira issue. I saw there was an option to create a page, but it opens a blank template; the issue information isn't summarized or copied over.\n\nI only mention this because there isn't a built-in way to move this information over to Confluence if I wanted to provide a short-term solution. Having a new connector to Jira is the right answer.",

The response should only consider a certain subset of documents/webpages that pertain to that member. Currently, FloridaBlue's website only shows certain UI elements to a member based on what is relevant for them. FB want to enable search using the same idea. I thought of a few approaches to solve for this:\n\nOption A - I can create multiple indices (or apps), each one based on a member type, and execute a search against that member type's index to get the relevant scoped response\n\nOption B - create a single index, and use advanced API and use the filters to consider which pages/documents are in or out of scope for that query, all based on the member interacting with the bot.\n\nOption C - create a single index, and use business rules to include or exclude certain pages/documents.\n\nOption A seems the least complex, but may require crawling some same content across the indices/apps. Options B and C are more complex and require more configuration and could be more cumbersome to maintain.\n\nI wanted to know what the SearchAi team recommends, or what other consideration I should look into before deciding the solution appoach."

Please check if the chunks sent to LLM contain the information that is part of the answer\n\n2. If the LLM response does not follow the format specified it can lead to issues in rendering.

Eg: Who is the CEO of Apple? \nChunk A: Tim Cook replaced Steve Jobs in 2011\nChunk B: Steve Jobs was the CEO of apple until 2011\n\n4.

Set up language rules and translation in the XO bot. \n4. For every end-user query, XO will identify the language and translate it into English. This english query then should be fed to Search via the Advanced Search API. \n5. For the answer returned by Search AI, XO can then again translate it to the correct language and return it to the user. \n\nThis would only cover the answer generation part, though. The documents and, hence, citations will continue to be in English.

        "Posting the response here as well for everyone's reference. \n\n1. Is there a hard limit on the number of FAQs we can upload?\nYes we have certain soft limits in place to avoid misuse of resources. For cloud environments it's very crucial to ensure few users are not overloading the resources as it can impact the performance for other users. \n\n2. Is it possible to upload additional FAQs beyond the soft limit?\nYes, it is possible to increase the soft limit. We can increase it for a specific app based on the app ID.  \n\n3. Can we increase the SearchAssist capacity for the Japan region?\nIncreasing this limit for JP environment may not be feasible. Please send a mail requesting for this for a specific app. Please mention the stream id/app id in the mail as the limit will be increased based on this. Additionally please ensure the correct approvals are in place. This is important so we can ensure the client is using the SearchAssist product according to the license agreement. \n\n4. Could you let me know the theoretical maximum for updating FAQs or Crawl records if requested by the customer?\nThere isn't a specific limit for how much content can be ingested. We can support large quantities of data, but the performance would vary based on the client's budget and hardware provisions. As the content size increases we would recommend the customer to go for a on-prem or VPC setup that can be set up according to their requirements."
