            "text": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.</p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>But what if I own legal copies of the material?</b></span></p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.</p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>What is legal to download?</b></span></p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>How will the rights-holder know?</b></span></p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.</p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.</p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>What happens if I get caught?</b></span></p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.</p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.</p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?</b></span></p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.</p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.</p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p> </p>",

While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam.</p>\n<p>To reduce the amount of spam you receive:</p>\n<ul><li>Don&#39;t reply to spam</li><li>Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used</li><li>Be proactive  <br /><br /></li></ul>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Don&#39;t reply to spam</strong></p>\n<p>If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. </li><li>If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn&#39;t check a box marked Don&#39;t send me product updates). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. </li><li>If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company&#39;s site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. </li><li>If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.<br /><br /></li></ul>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used</strong></p>\n<p>Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.</p>\n<p>Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. </li><li>Think twice before offering your email address to a web site.

Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.</p>\n<p>If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.</p>",

            "text": "<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">What is Spam?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Spam has increasingly become a problem on the Internet. While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam.&#39;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Definitions</span></h2>\n<p>The term &#34;spam&#34; is Internet slang that refers to unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or unsolicited bulk email (UBE). Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail. Unsolicited email most often contains advertisements for services or products, but very few reputable marketers use UCE to advertise. The most commonly seen spam includes the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Phishing scams, a very popular and dangerous form of email fraud</li><li>Foreign bank scams or advance fee fraud schemes</li><li>Pyramid schemes, including multilevel marketing (MLM)</li><li>Other &#34;Get Rich Quick&#34; or &#34;Make Money Fast&#34; (MMF) schemes</li><li>Quack health products and remedies</li><li>Ads for pornographic web sites</li><li>Offers of software for collecting email addresses and sending UCE</li><li>Offers of bulk emailing services for sending UCE</li><li>Chain letters (see About chain mail)</li><li>Illegally pirated software (&#34;Warez&#34;)</li></ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To reduce the amount of spam you receive:</span></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Don&#39;t reply to spam</li><li>Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used</li><li>Be proactive  </li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Don&#39;t reply to spam</span></h2>\n<p>If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. </li><li>If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn&#39;t check a box marked <span class=\"menuitem\">Don&#39;t send me product updates</span>). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. </li><li>If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company&#39;s site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. </li><li>If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.</li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used</span></h2>\n<p>Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.</p>\n<p>Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. </li><li>Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site&#39;s privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. </li><li>If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.</li><li>Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. </li><li>Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. </li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be proactive</span></h2>\n<p>Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure.

Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.</p>\n<p>If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.</p>",

These messages usually direct you to a spoofed web site or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft.</p>\n<p>One type of phishing attempt is an email message stating that you are receiving it due to fraudulent activity on your account, and asking you to &#34;click here&#34; to verify your information.</p>\n<p>Phishing scams are crude social engineering tools designed to induce panic in the reader. These scams attempt to trick recipients into responding or clicking immediately, by claiming they will lose something (e.g., email, bank account). Such a claim is always indicative of a phishing scam, as responsible companies and organizations will never take these types of actions via email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Specific types of phishing</strong></span></p>\n<p>Phishing scams vary widely in terms of their complexity, the quality of the forgery, and the attacker&#39;s objective. Several distinct types of phishing have emerged.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Spear phishing</span></h3>\n<p>Phishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as &#34;spear phishing&#34;. Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success.</p>\n<p>The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Whaling</span></h3>\n<p>The term &#34;whaling&#34; is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Avoiding phishing scams</span></h2>\n<p>The Company and other reputable organizations will never use email to request that you reply with your passphrase, Social Security number, or confidential personal information. Be suspicious of any email message that asks you to enter or verify personal information, through a web site or by replying to the message itself. Never reply to or click the links in a message. If you think the message may be legitimate, go directly to the company&#39;s web site (i.e., type the real URL into your browser) or contact the company to see if you really do need to take the action described in the email message.</p>\n<p>When you recognize a phishing message, delete the email message from your Inbox, and then empty it from the deleted items folder to avoid accidentally accessing the web sites it points to.</p>\n<p>Always read your email as plain text.</p>\n<p>Phishing messages often contain clickable images that look legitimate; by reading messages in plain text, you can see the URLs that any images point to. Additionally, when you allow your mail client to read HTML or other non-text-only formatting, attackers can take advantage of your mail client&#39;s ability to execute code, which leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses, worms, and Trojans.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Warnings</strong></span></p>\n<p>Reading email as plain text is a general best practice that, while avoiding some phishing attempts, won&#39;t avoid them all. Some legitimate sites use redirect scripts that don&#39;t check the redirects. Consequently, phishing perpetrators can use these scripts to redirect from legitimate sites to their fake sites.</p>\n<p>Another tactic is to use a homograph attack, which, due to International Domain Name (IDN) support in modern browsers, allows attackers to use different languagecharacter sets to produce URLs that look remarkably like the authentic ones.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Reporting phishing attempts</span></h2>\n<ul><li>If the phishing attempt targets the Company in any way (e.g., asks for the Company&#39;s Webmail users to &#34;verify their accounts&#34;, includes a malicious PDF directed to human resources, or impersonates the Company), forward it with full headers to the Company Information Security Office. </li><li>You can report a phishing scam attempt to the company that is being spoofed. </li><li>You can also send reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </li><li>Depending on where you live, some local authorities also accept phishing scam reports. </li><li>Finally, you can send details to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is building a database of common scams to which people can refer.</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Example of a phishing scam</strong></span></p>\n<p>The following phishing scam was targeted at Servicenow users:</p>\n<pre class=\"example\">-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;supportteam01&#64;indiana.edu&gt;\nReply-To: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;spupportteam&#64;info.lt&gt;\nDate: Sat, 12 Jul 2008 17:42:05 -0400\nTo: &lt;&#34;Undisclosed-Recipient:;&#34;&#64;iocaine.uits.indiana.edu&gt;\nSubject: CONFIRM YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nDear SERVICENOW.ORG Webmail Subscriber\n\nThis mail is to inform all our {SERVICENOW.ORG} webmail users that we\nwill be maintaining and upgrading our website in a couple of days from\nnow.As a Subscriber you are required to send us your Email account\ndetails to enable us know if you are still making use of your\nmailbox.

Windows 7 was released three years after Vista and comes with more advanced features and many bug fixes, but has the same hardware requirements. Should you choose to install Vista, use the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor to make sure your computer is capable of running Vista.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">System requirements</span></h2>\n<p>Microsoft&#39;s system requirements for Vista are listed below.</p>\n<p>Microsoft lists Windows Vista hardware requirements in two categories, Vista Capable and Vista Premium Ready. Vista Capable computers are able to run Vista, but may have limitations in the functionality of some features. Vista Capable minimum hardware requirements are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>A modern processor (at least 800 MHz)</li><li>512 MB of system memory</li><li>A graphics processor that is DirectX 9 capable</li><li>20 GB of hard drive capacity with 15 GB free space</li><li>CD-ROM drive</li></ul>\n<p>Vista Premium Ready computers can take full advantage of the features available in Vista, including the Windows Aero advanced graphical interface. Microsoft lists the minimum hardware requirements for Vista Premium as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor <br />UITS recommends: A dual-core (Core 2) processor </li><li>1 GB of system memory <br />UITS recommends: 2 GB system memory </li><li>A graphics processor that is DirectX 9 capable with Hardware Pixel Shader v2.0 and WDDM Driver support </li><li>128 MB of graphics memory <br />UITS recommends: 256 MB graphics memory; non-integrated video card </li><li>40 GB of hard drive capacity with 15 GB free space <br />UITS recommends: 80-100 GB capacity </li><li>DVD-ROM drive </li><li>Audio output capability </li><li>Internet access capability</li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Vista versions</span></h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re upgrading from Vista Home Premium, you need to upgrade to Vista Ultimate (notVista Business) if you want to keep Windows Media Center. For information about upgrading from an earlier version of Windows, see Microsoft&#39;s <a title=\"\" href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista#section_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Installing and reinstalling Windows Vista</a>.</p>",

            "text": "<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware/Adware</strong></span></p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and/or networking protocol.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses</span></strong></p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary</em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.</p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.</p>\n</li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br /><br /></li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.</li></ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware/Adware from your computer:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Preventing Spyware / Adware</b></span><br />Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware/Adware.</p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.</p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <b>Close</b> or select the active window and use <b>Alt &#43; F4 </b>on your keyboard.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Removing SpyWare / Adware</b></span><br />Many Spyware/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. </p>\n<p> </p>",

The warranty begins the day the computer is shipped, not when you receive it.</p>\n<p> If you think that you have a hardware problem and are not sure, please call the OIT Help Desk at 8-HELP. A Help Desk representative will determine if the problem is caused by hardware or software. If it is determined to be a hardware problem, a Hardware Support technician will be dispatched to your office to repair your computer. </p>\n<p><strong>What Are CRUs?</strong></p>\n<p> The Dell laptops come with many CRUs (customer replaceable units). Dell does not reimburse HWS for any work done on these items. If you suspect one of these components has failed and the Help Desk, your SCAD representative or STC representative has determined your trouble to be hardware failure, you will need to contact Dell - please see the Hardware Support warranty page for information on numbers to call.</p>\n<p>The following are examples of CRUs:</p>\n<ul><li>Floppy Drive/LS-120/Zip drive</li><li>External Floppy Drive Cable</li><li>External Media Cable</li><li>External Media Sleeve</li><li>CD-ROMs/CD-RW/DVD drive</li><li>PCMCIA Card</li><li>Main Battery</li><li>Travel Module</li><li>AC Adapter</li><li>Power Cord</li><li>Mini PCI Card Assembly</li><li>Memory Modules</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally, Dell desktop systems also have CRUs. Again these are not reimbursable to Hardware Support and are dealt with by the customers also. Computer Replaceable Units are:</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboards</li><li>Mice</li><li>Monitors</li><li>External Speakers</li></ul>\n<p>If one of these items needs to be replaced, you can contact Dell directly. Have your system tag number ready. When you contact Dell, they will make arrangements to have replacement parts advance shipped directly to you for immediate replacement. A return prepaid air bill will be provided for the return of your defective part. If a customer does NOT want to deal with Dell, Hardware Support can certainly obtain these items under warranty and replace them for a labor charge.</p>\n<p>Hardware Support provides service for all computers regardless of their warranty. For information regarding services and pricing for warrantied and non-warrantied computers, please see the Hardware Support warranty page.</p>",

            "text": "<h2>Installing the Eclipse Plugin</h2> <p>Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android Development Tools (ADT). This plugin provides a powerful, integrated environment in which to develop Android apps. It extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, build an app UI, debug your app, and export signed (or unsigned) app packages (APKs) for distribution.</p> <p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> If you have been using Eclipse with ADT, be aware that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Android Studio</a> is now the official IDE for Android, so you should migrate to Android Studio to receive all the latest IDE updates. For help moving projects, see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Migrating to Android Studio</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>You should install the ADT plugin only if you already have an Eclipse installation that you want to continue using. Your existing Eclipse installation must meet these requirements:</p> <ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eclipse.org/mobile/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Eclipse</a> 3.7.2 (Indigo) or greater <p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) is no longer supported with the latest version of ADT.</p> </li><li>Eclipse <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/jdt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">JDT</a> plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">JDK 6</a> (JRE alone is not sufficient)</li><li><strong>Not</strong> compatible with GNU Compiler for Java (gcj)</li></ul> <h2 id=\"Download\">Download the ADT Plugin</h2> <hr /> <p>To add the ADT plugin to Eclipse:</p> <ol><li>Start Eclipse, then select <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Install New Software</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add</strong>, in the top-right corner.</li><li>In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter &#34;ADT Plugin&#34; for the <em>Name</em> and the following URL for the <em>Location</em>: <pre class=\"prettyprint\"><span class=\"pln\">https</span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"com\">//dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</span></pre> <p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> The Android Developer Tools update site requires a secure connection. Make sure the update site URL you enter starts with HTTPS.</p> </li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>In the next window, you&#39;ll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Read and accept the license agreements, then click <strong>Finish</strong>. <p>If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can&#39;t be established, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p> </li><li>When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.</li></ol> <h2 id=\"Configure\">Configure the ADT Plugin</h2> <hr /> <p>Once Eclipse restarts, you must specify the location of your Android SDK directory:</p> <ol><li>In the &#34;Welcome to Android Development&#34; window that appears, select <strong>Use existing SDKs</strong>.</li><li>Browse and select the location of the Android SDK directory you recently downloaded and unpacked.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li></ol> <p>Your Eclipse IDE is now set up to develop Android apps, but you need to add the latest SDK platform tools and an Android platform to your environment. To get these packages for your SDK, continue to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Adding Platforms and Packages</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"Troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting ADT Installation</h2> <hr /> <p>If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the steps above and you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse, you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in <strong>Window</strong> (on Mac OS X, <strong>Eclipse</strong>) &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt;<strong>Network Connections</strong>.</p> <p>If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and manually install it:</p> <ol><li>Download the ADT Plugin zip file (do not unpack it): <table class=\"download\"><tbody><tr><th>Package</th><th>Size</th><th>MD5 Checksum</th></tr><tr><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dl.google.com/android/ADT-23.0.6.zip\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">ADT-23.0.6.zip</a></td><td>103344298 bytes</td><td>f64b7e50c84799f41c642218c35f1bbe</td></tr></tbody></table> </li><li>Start Eclipse, then select <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Install New Software</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add</strong>, in the top-right corner.</li><li>In the Add Repository dialog, click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li><li>Select the downloaded ADT-23.0.6.zip file and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Enter &#34;ADT Plugin&#34; for the name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>In the next window, you&#39;ll see a list of the tools to be downloaded.

If you encounter an error when installing ADT, your Eclipse installation might not include these packages. For information about how to quickly add the necessary packages to your Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/resources/faq/troubleshooting.html#installeclipsecomponents\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">ADT Installation Error: &#34;requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui&#34;</a>.</p> <h4>For Linux users</h4> <p>If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse:</p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\"><span class=\"typ\">An</span><span class=\"pln\"> error occurred during provisioning</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\"><br /></span><span class=\"typ\">Cannot</span><span class=\"pln\"> connect to keystore</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\"><br />JKS</span></pre> <p>...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM.

Two-Factor Authentication is a robust and proven method that significantly enhances the security of your accounts. Reputations are valuable assets, and if a security incident happens, it can tarnish an image in the eyes of customers, partners, and the general public. We know that your confidence in our ability to safeguard your data is crucial. We want to reassure you that we are investing in stronger security measures and continuously monitoring and improving our systems by bring 2FA to your accounts. There are more than <a target=\"_self\">24 billion usernames and passwords</a> on the dark web as of June 2022. Hackers are getting smarter every day and username/passwords are vulnerable to risk of unauthorized access, brute force attacks, various cyber threats, such as phishing, credential stuffing, password breaches and can be stolen by third parties. Enforcing the use of a 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and increases confidence that your accounts will stay safe from cyber criminals.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
