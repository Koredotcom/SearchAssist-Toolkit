# Search Implementation Analysis Questionnaire

## 1. Data Volume and Characteristics

### 1.1 Web Pages
- How many web pages need to be indexed?
  - *Justification: Volume impacts chunking strategy. >500 pages suggests page-based chunking*
  - *Example: A client with 1000 product documentation pages benefited from page-based chunking, while another with 300 blog posts worked better with token-based chunking*

- What is the average content length per page?
  - *Justification: Helps determine token limits and chunking approach*
  - *Example: Pages with 2000+ words (~3000 tokens) perform better with page-based chunks, while shorter 500-word articles work well with 400-token chunks*

- Is there significant content overlap between pages?
  - *Justification: Content duplication affects embedding strategy and relevancy*
  - *Example: An event organization based client have event descriptions repeated across pages, requiring exclusion of duplicate sections from embeddings to prevent bias*

### 1.2 Files
- Total number of files to be processed?
  - *Justification: >200 pages across files suggests page-based chunking*
  - *Example: A legal firm with 500 contract documents (averaging 20 pages each) achieved better results with page-based chunking, while a small business with 50 policy documents worked well with token-based chunks*

- What are the file types? (PDF, DOC, etc.)
  - *Justification: Different file types may require different extraction strategies*
  - *Example: A client with technical drawings in PDFs required layout-aware extraction, while plain text reports worked fine with standard extraction*

- Do files contain tables, images, or complex layouts?
  - *Justification: Determines if layout-aware extraction is needed*
  - *Example: Financial reports with complex tables required layout-aware extraction to maintain data relationships, while simple text documents didn't need it*

### 1.3 Content Structure
- Is the content highly structured or unstructured?
  - *Justification: Affects parsing and chunking strategies*
  - *Example: An organization user manual which has structured steps to solve or implement required custom section-based chunking, while blog posts worked with standard token-based chunking*

## 2. Search Patterns and Requirements

### 2.1 Query Analysis
- What types of queries will users typically make?
  - *Justification: Affects search strategy (semantic vs keyword)*
  - *Example Queries:*
    - Semantic: "What are the symptoms of system failure?"
    - Keyword: "Price of Product X in 2024"

- Are queries mostly industry-specific terms?
  - *Justification: May require hybrid search approach*
  - *Example: A pharmaceutical company's queries like "mechanism of action for Drug-X" required hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching*

### 2.2 Answer Requirements
- What is the expected answer format?
  - *Justification: Affects prompt engineering and response formatting*
  - *Example Formats:*
    - Concise: "The price is $499"
    - Detailed: "Product X, launched in 2024, is priced at $499. This includes..."
    - Structured: "1. Features: [...] 2. Benefits: [...]"

## 3. Performance Expectations

### 3.1 Response Time
- What is the acceptable response time range?
  - *Justification: Influences chunk size and number of chunks sent to LLM*
  - *Example: A customer service application required <2 second responses, leading to reduced chunk sizes and optimized retrieval*

### 3.2 Accuracy Requirements
- Minimum acceptable relevancy score?
  - *Justification: Helps tune search and retrieval parameters*
  - *Example: A medical information system required 90%+ relevancy, necessitating:*
    - Increased chunk overlap
    - Hybrid search implementation
    - Custom medical term weighting
- Are false positives more concerning than false negatives?
  - *Justification: Influences precision vs recall trade-offs*

## 4. Domain-Specific Requirements

### 4.1 Industry Context
- What industry-specific terminology is used?
  - *Justification: May require custom embeddings or search strategies*
  - *Example: A legal firm's document search needed to handle terms like:*
    ```
    Standard Terms: contract, agreement, clause
    Industry-Specific: force majeure, indemnification, jurisdiction
    Company-Specific: internal procedure codes, document reference formats
    ```
    
- Are there domain-specific abbreviations or jargon?
  - *Justification: Affects tokenization and search strategies*
    
### 4.2 Data Sensitivity
- Are there any sensitive data handling requirements?
  - *Justification: May affect processing and storage strategies*
  - *Example: A healthcare provider required:*
    ```- Role-based access controls```

## 5. Update Patterns

### 5.1 Content Updates
- How frequently is content updated?
  - *Justification: Affects indexing strategy and refresh rates*
  - *Example Update Patterns:*
    ```
    High Frequency: E-commerce product catalog (daily updates)
    Medium Frequency: Knowledge base (weekly updates)
    Low Frequency: Policy documents (quarterly updates)
    ```

## Recommended Configuration Matrix

Based on responses, here are example configurations for common scenarios:

- Daily index updates
```

### Scenario 2: Small Business Knowledge Base
```
Data Characteristics:
- 200 articles
- Simple text content
- Monthly updates

Recommended Config:
- Token-based chunking (400 tokens)
- Semantic search
- 20 chunks sent to LLM
- Weekly index updates
```

### Scenario 3: Technical Documentation with Complex Layout
```

- Hybrid search
- 15 chunks sent to LLM
```

## Implementation Checklist

1. Baseline Performance Measurement
```
□ Document current relevancy scores
□ Track response times
□ Note frequent search failures
```

2. Configuration Optimization
```
□ Implement recommended chunking strategy
□ Adjust search configuration
□ Fine-tune prompt engineering
□ Test with sample queries
```

3. Validation
```
□ Compare new relevancy scores
□ Verify response times
□ Document improvements
```

This questionnaire should be used iteratively, with results and learnings fed back into the process for continuous improvement. Each client implementation may reveal new patterns that can be added to these examples.
