## Solving Document Structure Issues for Knowledge Extraction Using LLMs

In the realm of knowledge extraction from document repositories, organizations often face challenges related to the structure and organization of content. This article discusses a real-world scenario where our large banking client encountered two specific problems while using a search assistance platform to retrieve answers from Salesforce knowledge articles.

## The Challenges

1. **Missing Hierarchy Information**: The table of contents within the documents had a hierarchical structure, but the parent-child relationship information was not available in every child section. This lack of explicit hierarchical information made it difficult to accurately capture the context and relationships between different sections, leading to potential misinterpretations or incomplete understanding.

2. **Incorrect Chunking**: When chunking the content based on tokens or other fixed criteria, the section headers might inadvertently include information from the previous section. This led to incorrect or incomplete answers being returned, as the context and boundaries of each section were not properly defined.

## The Solution

To address these challenges, we developed a solution that involved preprocessing the HTML documents before extracting structured data. The key steps in our approach were:

    InputHTML --> ParseHTML
    ParseHTML --> ExtractTableOfContents
    ExtractTableOfContents --> GenerateModifiedHTML
    GenerateModifiedHTML --> IdentifyParentChildRelationships
    IdentifyParentChildRelationships --> LeverageLLM
    LeverageLLM --> PrefixEachHeaderWithHierarchy
    PrefixEachHeaderWithHierarchy --> ExtractChunksBetweenHeaders
    ExtractChunksBetweenHeaders --> ConvertToSearchAISchema[ConvertToSearchAISchema]
    
```

## Parsing HTML for Structured Data Extraction

### **1. Parse HTML**
The first step is to parse the input HTML document to extract its structure and content using libraries like BeautifulSoup.

### **2. Extract and Expand Table of Contents (TOC)**
From the parsed HTML, we identify and extract the table of contents or index structure, which represents the sections and subsections of the document. This is typically done by analyzing specific HTML tags like `<ul>`, `<ol>`, etc. Additionally, we expand the TOC by handling situations where one index element may point to sub-indices within the same page, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the document's structure.

### **3. Generate Modified HTML**
After expaning the TOC, we generate a modified version of the HTML document that incorporates the updated structure.

### **4. Identify Parent-Child Relationships**
Using the extracted headers structure, we analyze and identify the parent-child relationships between the different sections and subsections. This involves understanding the nesting and hierarchy of the headers.

### **5. Leverage LLM for Hierarchical Expansion**
To overcome the challenge of missing hierarchy information, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We feed the extracted headers structure to the LLM, which analyzes the context and relationships between the headers and provides a hierarchical representation, including the parent-child relationships.

### **6. Prefix Each Header**
With the identified relationships from the LLM's output, we prefix each header with its parent section(s), providing the necessary context and hierarchy information.

### **7. Output Modified HTML**
The modified HTML document is then ready for further processing, such as extracting structured data.

### **8. Extract Chunks Between Headers**
To extract meaningful chunks of content, we iterate through the modified HTML document, locating the correct tags using the reference links (`href`) provided in the headings. We then collect all the intermediate elements until the next heading (present in the index) is encountered. These intermediate elements are combined into a single chunk, preserving the hierarchical context and boundaries between sections.

By leveraging the LLM's capabilities to understand and expand the hierarchical structure of the headers, and subsequently preprocessing the documents with explicit parent-child relationships, we provided the necessary context for accurate knowledge extraction.

### Implementation and Open-Source Contribution
The implementation of this solution is available as an open-source project on GitHub: [SearchAssist-Toolkit](https://github.com/username/SearchAssist-Toolkit). We believe that sharing this approach and code can benefit the broader community working with knowledge extraction and document understanding.

### Conclusion
Dealing with complex document structures and hierarchies can be a significant challenge when extracting knowledge. By leveraging the LLM's capabilities to understand and expand the hierarchical structure, and incorporating explicit parent-child relationships through preprocessing, we can provide the necessary context and significantly improve the accuracy of the extracted information. 

The solution presented in this article demonstrates how a combination of HTML parsing, header analysis, LLM integration, document modification, and intelligent chunking can effectively address these challenges. This approach not only solved our client's specific issues but also highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the intricacies of document structure when working with knowledge extraction and natural language processing tasks. By extracting high-quality, meaningful chunks that preserve the hierarchical context, we can ensure better retrieval accuracy. As organizations continue to leverage LLMs for various applications, such preprocessing techniques will become increasingly valuable in ensuring accurate and context-aware knowledge extraction from diverse document repositories.
