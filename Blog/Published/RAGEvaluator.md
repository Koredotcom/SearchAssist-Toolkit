# RAGEvaluator: Simplifying the Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Applications

*Author: Akhil Sainath Maddala*


## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a game-changer. RAG combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. But with great power comes great responsibility - how do we ensure that our RAG applications are performing as expected?

Enter [RAGEvaluator](https://github.com/Koredotcom/SearchAssist-Toolkit/tree/master/Evaluation/RAG_Evaluator), a powerful tool designed to assess and optimize RAG applications. In this blog post, we'll explore how RAGEvaluator works, why it's crucial for developers and data scientists, and how you can use it to improve your RAG-based systems.

## Introducing RAGEvaluator: A RAG Evaluation Solution

RAGEvaluator is an open-source tool that automates the process of evaluating RAG applications. It's designed to help developers, data scientists, and AI engineers measure the performance of their RAG systems across various dimensions.

Key features of RAGEvaluator include:

- Automated evaluation of retrieval quality
- Assessment of response relevance and coherence
- Measurement of hallucination rates
- Easy-to-understand performance reports

Whether you're fine-tuning a RAG system for a chatbot, developing a question-answering application, or building an AI-powered research assistant, RAGEvaluator provides valuable insights to guide your development process.

## Understanding RAG Evaluation

Before we dive into the specifics of RAGEvaluator, let's briefly discuss why evaluating RAG applications is so important.

RAG systems combine two critical components: a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, and a generation mechanism that produces human-like responses based on this information. While this approach can lead to more accurate and informative AI responses, it also introduces potential points of failure:

1. **Retrieval errors**: The system might fail to fetch the most relevant information.
2. **Integration issues**: The retrieved information might not be properly incorporated into the generated response.
3. **Hallucinations**: The LLM might generate false or irrelevant information not supported by the retrieved data.

Evaluating these aspects helps ensure that your RAG application is not just functional, but truly effective and reliable.

## How RAGEvaluator Works

RAGEvaluator operates by running your RAG application through a series of carefully designed test cases. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Input Processing**: RAGEvaluator takes in your RAG application details, test dataset, and configuration settings.
2. **Query Execution**: It runs a set of predefined queries through your RAG system.
3. **Response Analysis**: The tool analyzes the responses generated by your RAG application.
4. **Metric Calculation**: Various performance metrics are calculated based on the analysis.
5. **Report Generation**: A comprehensive report is produced with the evaluation results.

The RAG Evaluator assesses a RAG application using the widely recognized RAGAS and CRAG benchmarks.

- **[CRAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04744) (Comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:  Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and Knowledge Graph (KG) search.CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories. It reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds.
- **[RAGAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15217) (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Accuracy Score)**: Ragas is built on the idea that LLMs can effectively evaluate natural language output. It forms paradigms that overcome the biases of using LLMs as judges directly and provides continuous scores that are explainable and intuitive to understand.

### [RAGAS Metrics](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html)

1. **Context Precision**: Uses the question and retrieved contexts to measure the signal-to-noise ratio.
2. **Context Recall**: Uses the ground truth and retrieved contexts to check if all relevant information for the answer is retrieved.
3. **Faithfulness**: Uses the contexts and the bot answer to measure if the claims in the answer can be inferred from the context.
4. **Answer Relevancy**: Uses the question and the bot answer to assess whether the answer addresses the question (does not consider factuality but penalizes incomplete or redundant answers).
5. **Answer Correctness**: Uses the ground truth answer and the bot answer to assess the correctness of the bot answer.
6. **Answer Similarity**: Uses the ground truth and the generated answer to measure their semantic similarity, providing a score from 0 to 1 to indicate the alignment quality.

### CRAG Metrics

CRAG uses a scoring method to assess the performance of RAG systems based on the following criteria:

1. **Perfect**: The response correctly answers the user’s question and contains no hallucinated content.
2. **Acceptable**: The response provides a useful answer to the user’s question but may contain minor errors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer.
3. **Missing**: The response is “I don’t know”, “I’m sorry I can’t find ...”, a system error such as an empty response, or a request from the system to clarify the original question.
4. **Incorrect**: The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user’s question.

The scoring method,assigns scores of 1, 0.5, 0, and -1 for perfect, acceptable, missing, and incorrect answers, respectively. For a given RAG system, we compute the average score from all examples in the evaluation set as the final score.

These metrics provide a holistic view of your RAG application's performance, helping you identify areas for improvement.

##Getting Started with RAGEvaluator & Running Your First Evaluation
To start using RAGEvaluator, follow the installation setup and run your first evaluation as described here: [setup & running first evaluation](https://github.com/Koredotcom/SearchAssist-Toolkit/blob/akhilm/rag_evaluator/Evaluation/RAG_Evaluator/README.md).

## Interpreting the Results

RAGEvaluator provides a comprehensive report of your RAG application's performance. Here's a sample of what the output might look like:

```json5
{
    "answer_relevancy": 0.74,
    "faithfulness": 0.9,
    "context_recall": 0.69,
    "context_precision": 0.99,
    "answer_correctness": 0.54,
    "answer_similarity":0.96,
    "crag_eval_score": 0.2
}
```

These metrics give you a clear picture of how well your RAG application is performing across different dimensions.

## Best Practices and Tips

To get the most out of RAGEvaluator:

1. Use a diverse set of test queries that represent real-world usage of your application.
2. Regularly re-evaluate your RAG application, especially after making changes to your model or knowledge base.
3. Use RAGEvaluator in conjunction with human evaluation for a more comprehensive assessment.

## Use Cases and Examples

RAGEvaluator can be particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- Comparing different retrieval algorithms for your RAG system
- Assessing the impact of expanding or refining your knowledge base
- Monitoring the performance of a deployed RAG application over time
- Fine-tuning the balance between retrieval and generation in your responses
