The user will provide context, and your task is to answer the user's query at the end. Your response should adhere to the following format: **'Some relevant answer[chunk_id] Another relevant data[chunk_id]'**. In this format, you must strictly include the relevant answer or information followed by the chunk_id, which serves as a reference to the source of the data within the provided context. Importantly, place only the correct chunk_ids within square brackets. These chunk_ids must be located exclusively at the end of each content and indicated explicitly with a key 'chunk id.' Do not include any other text, words, or characters within square brackets. Your responses should also be properly formatted with all necessary special characters like new lines, tabs, and bullets, as required for clarity and presentation. If there are multiple answers present in the provided context, you should include all of them in your response. You should only provide an answer if you can extract the information directly from the content provided by the user. If you have partial information, you should still provide the partial answer.Always send relevant and correct chunk_ids with the answer fragments.

Set clear expectations with clients When working part-time hours, you must be transparent regarding when you’re available and how much time you can commit—not responding when a client needs you can quickly erode their trust. 2. Batch your digital marketing work Marketing is one of the most important—and time-consuming—aspects of growing your real estate business. Get caught up on marketing materials by completing a week’s or month’s worth of one task at a time, a strategy known as “batching.” For example, you might set aside two hours on one day to write all your social media posts for the month. The next day, you might focus on compiling a list of leads and, the following day, sending them cold emails. 3. Use a calendar and digital reminders Are you worried you’ll forget to respond to a client’s question or, worse, not show up to a meeting? Avoid these mishaps by scheduling tasks, meetings, and admin work on your calendar or setting up reminders on your phone. 4. Leverage automated tools and platforms Many routine tasks can be automated with modern technology. Look online for platforms that can help you with tasks such as: - Lead generation - Marketing emails - Cold calling - SMS or email lead follow-up - Contract creation - Social media posting - Appointment scheduling |Psst! With PropStream, you can automate your lead generation with our List Automator add-on. Additionally, create an email or postcard campaign within the platform or perform a skip trace. | 5.

Here’s the good news: You can still build a lucrative career as a part-time real estate agent. However, this career path takes hard work, time management skills, and strategic marketing.

For example, it can be hard to predict when clients will be available to view homes or meet with you, and closings often need to take place during office hours. This may be challenging if you have a full-time job with rigid office hours. You’ll also need to fit the tasks of a full-time agent into a part-time schedule.

In this article, we’ll look at what you should know about flipping houses and taxes before you buy your first fixer-upper. House-Flipping Taxes: The Basics How much you pay in taxes when flipping houses depends entirely on whether the IRS views you as a real estate investor or a real estate dealer. It also depends on your overall income in the year you sell the house, how you’re filing your taxes, and where you live. Important Note: As part of your research you may have seen that there have been court cases over these taxes because the laws surrounding house-flipper taxes aren’t clear-cut. We recommend consulting with an attorney and accountant before buying a home to flip or filing your taxes in your state. Real Estate Investor vs. Real Estate Dealer In general, a real estate investor is someone who owns and holds properties long-term. A real estate dealer, on the other hand, purchases and sells properties quickly and repeatedly. That’s why the IRS ends up categorizing many wholesalers and house flippers as real estate dealers instead of investors. If the government classifies your house flips as dealer activities, it can increase how much you pay in taxes.

To find these clients, agents often resort to desperate measures, like going door-to-door in every nearby neighborhood. Not only does this method waste time, but it leaves you facing unpredictable situations, like less-than-welcoming homeowners or rowdy dogs jumping on you and soiling your expensive business attire! Even if you don\'t physically go door-to-door, you can wind up spending a fortune blanketing entire neighborhoods with glossy postcards, only for them to end up in the garbage. What if there was a better way for agents to consistently find clients within their niche? Well, there is! Combined, technology and big data are great solutions for lead generation. Unfortunately, time-strapped agents can be intimidated by technology and may not know where to start when implementing it into their business. This is why PropStream, the industry leader in real estate big data, has designed a free course (available in their PropStream Academy) called, "PropStream for Agents: Landing New Leads and Listings." In this free course, you’ll learn how to use technology to find off-market inventory and how that can translate to new clients and listings.

                'chunkText': 'Finding new clients to market and build relationships with is a top priority for real estate agents who are looking for more listings. To find these clients, agents often resort to desperate measures, like going door-to-door in every nearby neighborhood. Not only does this method waste time, but it leaves you facing unpredictable situations, like less-than-welcoming homeowners or rowdy dogs jumping on you and soiling your expensive business attire! Even if you don\'t physically go door-to-door, you can wind up spending a fortune blanketing entire neighborhoods with glossy postcards, only for them to end up in the garbage. What if there was a better way for agents to consistently find clients within their niche? Well, there is! Combined, technology and big data are great solutions for lead generation. Unfortunately, time-strapped agents can be intimidated by technology and may not know where to start when implementing it into their business. This is why PropStream, the industry leader in real estate big data, has designed a free course (available in their PropStream Academy) called, "PropStream for Agents: Landing New Leads and Listings." In this free course, you’ll learn how to use technology to find off-market inventory and how that can translate to new clients and listings. By using PropStream, agents can quickly discover hidden segments in their neighborhood, like: - Owners with financial strain (pre-foreclosure, liens, etc.) - Vacant properties - Absentee Owners looking to sell - Senior Owners and empty nesters looking to downsize - Tired Landlords and real estate investors looking to modify their portfolio To support your learning, you can also attend a Live Webinar and ask our product experts in-depth questions about using PropStream as a business tool.

The income you make from a wholesaling deal is typically subject to regular income tax as most wholesalers collect an assignment fee and don't sell the property themselves. To avoid losing a larger chunk of your wholesale commission than necessary or getting into trouble with the IRS, you may want to consult a tax professional. How to Reduce Your Tax Burden as a House Flipper Even though most house flippers don’t get the same tax benefits as long-term investors, there are still several things you can do to reduce your overall tax burden. Tip: Remember, this article isn’t meant to be taken as personal legal or tax advice. Make sure you speak with your professional tax advisor and attorney before buying a house you want to flip. Operate Under a Separate Business Putting your house-flipping activities in a separate LLC can help offset certain taxes. If you elect S Corporation status, you can reduce the amount you pay in self-employment tax by taking part of the profit as a salary and the rest as a distribution. (Ask your CPA about the best way to do this.) Separating your active real estate dealings from your passive investments can also help protect you from paying a higher tax rate on all your real estate income. Flip Your Own Home If flipping houses isn’t your main source of income, you can reduce taxes on a sale by using the Section 121 exclusion. This allows you to exclude up to $250,000 of the gain on your taxes (or up to $500,000 if you’re married and filing jointly).

And if your income exceeds $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly), then you’ll also need to pay the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). Taxes for Real Estate Dealers Most serious house flippers don’t qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates because they aren’t classified as investors. Why? Because in order to make a livable income flipping homes, you’d have to sell multiple homes per year. In most cases, that would cause the IRS to classify you as a dealer. As a dealer, you have to pay regular income tax on the profit you make from flipping houses. You also pay a self-employment tax of 15.3%. (These are the same as FICA taxes, which go toward Medicare and Social Security.) Another thing to keep in mind is that dealers can’t take advantage of certain real estate tax benefits. For example, dealers aren’t allowed to do 1031 exchanges (pronounced “ten-thirty-one”), which would allow you to put off paying taxes on a home sale by using the profit to pay for another property of equal or greater value.

Here’s the rate you can expect to pay based on your taxable income and filing status: |Long-term capital gains tax rate (2022) ||Taxable income (Single) ||Taxable income (Married filing jointly) | |0% ||$0 - $41,675 ||$0 - $83,350 | |15% ||$41,676 - $459,750 ||$83,351 - $517,200 | |20% ||$459,751+ ||$517,201+ | Depending on where you live, you may also have to pay state capital gains tax. And if your income exceeds $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly), then you’ll also need to pay the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). Taxes for Real Estate Dealers Most serious house flippers don’t qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates because they aren’t classified as investors. Why? Because in order to make a livable income flipping homes, you’d have to sell multiple homes per year. In most cases, that would cause the IRS to classify you as a dealer. As a dealer, you have to pay regular income tax on the profit you make from flipping houses. You also pay a self-employment tax of 15.3%. (These are the same as FICA taxes, which go toward Medicare and Social Security.) Another thing to keep in mind is that dealers can’t take advantage of certain real estate tax benefits. For example, dealers aren’t allowed to do 1031 exchanges (pronounced “ten-thirty-one”), which would allow you to put off paying taxes on a home sale by using the profit to pay for another property of equal or greater value.

The region currently boasts a thriving job market, strong demand for housing inventory, a growing population of home buyers, and promising home value growth. Interested in capitalizing on these trends? Whether you're a home buyer, seller, or investor, Tampa is bursting with opportunity right now. Here's what you should know about Tampa's housing market: Average Home Prices Are Surging As of March 2022, the median sales price of a single-family home in Tampa was $390,000. This represents a 30% increase over last year. Condos within the region are following the same trend, too. In the same time frame, the median sales price for a condo rose by 25.6% to $270,000. Of course, specific pricing varies by neighborhood. Suburbs like Davis Islands, Grand Hampton, Old Seminole Heights, Oldsmar, Spring Hill, Sun Bay South, Tampa Heights, and Tampa Palms are all popular spots with great investment opportunities. Tight Supply a Key Factor in Rising Home Prices As in other hot metro areas, tight supply is playing a major role in the Tampa market. In March, the whole Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had less than one month of available inventory. Housing stock availability decreased by nearly 14.3%;over the previous 12 months. Six months of supply often causes modest price rises. With a supply that amounts to only a few weeks, it's no wonder Tampa is seeing major price pressure. This low supply of inventory makes Tampa a strong seller's market. Buyer demand currently far outpaces supply, and experts don't expect this to change anytime soon.

Set clear expectations with clients When working part-time hours, you must be transparent regarding when you’re available and how much time you can commit—not responding when a client needs you can quickly erode their trust. 2.
